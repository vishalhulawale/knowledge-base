# Supervised Learning
- Type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.
- The model learns to map inputs to outputs based on the provided labels.
- Y = f(X) + ε where: Y is the output, X is the input, f is the function learned by the model, and ε is the error term.
- Input is called "features" and output is called "label".
    ## Regression
    - Branch of machine learning focused on predicting continuous outcomes.

    ## Classification
    - Branch of machine learning focused on predicting categorical outcomes.
    - Binary Classification - Classifying data into two distinct categories.
    - Multi-class Classification - Classifying data into more than two categories.
    - Support Vector Machines (SVM) - A supervised learning model that finds the hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space.

## Clustering
- Branch of machine learning focused on grouping similar data points together without predefined labels.

## Association Rule Learning
- Branch of machine learning focused on discovering interesting relationships between variables in large datasets.

## Deep Learning
- Subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze various factors of data.
- Complex Algorithms
- More computing resources required

## Shallow Learning
- Refers to traditional machine learning techniques that do not involve deep neural networks.
