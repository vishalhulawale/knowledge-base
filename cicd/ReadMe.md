## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- SDLC is a methgodology that defines the steps needed for software development teams to create high-quality software in a systematic and efficient manner.

1. Requirements Gathering
   - Defining the objectives
   - Identifying the stakeholders
   - Gathering functional and non-functional requirements.

2. Planning
   - Developing a project plan that outlines the scope, timeline, and resources needed.
   - Identifying potential risks and mitigation strategies.

3. Design
   - Creating architectural designs and system specifications.
   - Designing user interfaces and user experiences.

4. Implementation
   - Writing code based on the design specifications.
   - Conducting unit tests to ensure individual components work as intended.

5. Testing
   - Performing integration testing to ensure components work together.
   - Conducting system testing to validate the entire system against requirements.
   - Executing user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.

6. Deployment
   - Releasing the software to production environments.
   - Ensuring that deployment processes are automated where possible.

## Source Control
- Source control is a system that records changes to files or sets of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
- Common source control systems include Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial.

## SDLC Roadblocks
- **Pinpointing the Root Issue***: Accurately identifying the initial problem is crucial for effective resolution.
- ***Environment Conflicts***: Solving "It works on my machine" issues by ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- ***Overcoming Delivery Delays***: Streamlining the software release process to avoid bottlenecks and ensure timely delivery.
- ***User Centered Development***: Focusing on user needs and feedback throughout the development process to create a product that meets user expectations.
- ***Competitive Advantage***: Leveraging unique features and capabilities to differentiate the software in the market.
