## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
- SDLC is a methgodology that defines the steps needed for software development teams to create high-quality software in a systematic and efficient manner.

1. Requirements Gathering
   - Defining the objectives
   - Identifying the stakeholders
   - Gathering functional and non-functional requirements.

2. Planning
   - Developing a project plan that outlines the scope, timeline, and resources needed.
   - Identifying potential risks and mitigation strategies.

3. Design
   - Creating architectural designs and system specifications.
   - Designing user interfaces and user experiences.

4. Implementation
   - Writing code based on the design specifications.
   - Conducting unit tests to ensure individual components work as intended.

5. Testing
   - Performing integration testing to ensure components work together.
   - Conducting system testing to validate the entire system against requirements.
   - Executing user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.

6. Deployment
   - Releasing the software to production environments.
   - Ensuring that deployment processes are automated where possible.

## Source Control
- Source control is a system that records changes to files or sets of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
- It allows multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
- Common source control systems include Git, Subversion (SVN), and Mercurial.

## SDLC Roadblocks
- **Pinpointing the Root Issue***: Accurately identifying the initial problem is crucial for effective resolution.
- ***Environment Conflicts***: Solving "It works on my machine" issues by ensuring consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- ***Overcoming Delivery Delays***: Streamlining the software release process to avoid bottlenecks and ensure timely delivery.
- ***User Centered Development***: Focusing on user needs and feedback throughout the development process to create a product that meets user expectations.
- ***Competitive Advantage***: Leveraging unique features and capabilities to differentiate the software in the market.

## DevOps
- It is a philosophy tha, a set of rules and practices that define a culture that aims to bridge the gap between development and operations teams.
- Purpose of DevOps is to facilitate and encourage collaboration between departments.

## Cagen's 4 questions for Product Discovery
1. Will the user but this?
2. Can the user figure out how to use it?   
3. Can our engineers build it?
4. Can our stakeholders support it?

These questions help in validating the product idea and ensuring that it meets user needs, is technically feasible, and has stakeholder support.
